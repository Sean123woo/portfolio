        <h1>Ginger Bread Cookie Recipe</h1>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Chinese ginger bread cookie recipes were developed during the 10th century
        <br>and by the <strong>late</strong> Middle Ages, Europeans had their own version of gingerbread.
        <br>The hard cookies, sometimes gilded with <u>gold leaf</u> and shaped like animals, kings
        <br>and queens, were a staple at Medieval fairs in England, France, Holland and Germany.
